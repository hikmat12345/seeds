review_text: "I live here and I would like to comment on some things that might be different from what you expect:

- Walkability: Definitely not great, the city is huge, there are neighborhood where is safe to walk, with interesting stuff to do, but this isn't the case on most places far from west zone (Pinheiros and Vila Madalena) and Paulista avenue. Expect to use public transportation (subway and buses) and uber a lot. 

- LGBTQ+: Sao Paulo is the state with most homicides against trans people in the whole country. Violence against all LGBTQ+ is surging rampantly, you can search for it, there are some good of articles in English with data. 

- Hospitals: There are great hospitals here, but they are, as a majority, private and will cost you to use any service. Public hospitals are available, but don't expect English speaking staff or short queues, they are pretty packed (even after midnight).

Prices are way off too, in the good and safe neighborhoods, don't expect to pay less that 10USD for a meal in a sit-in restaurant. There are cheaper options, but they will hardly have English speaking staff.",

review_text: "Sao Paulo is a place of high contrasts. Massive buildings, roads, and road rage co-exist with peaceful parks, fantastic skies, and very kind locals. Before you go, make sure you have the right expectations because this place is the South American equivalent of LA or NYC. It is absurdly different from Rio as far as the activities and landscape. Some of my favorite things are the 20,000+ restaurants and bars, people watching (more contrast), free art museums and attractions, and the fantastic co-working spaces (not cheap, but some very well designed). On September 2021, 1 dollar buys 5.19 reais (local currency). One of the reviews mentions cold but this Spring, the temperatures are hitting 95-100F consistently. It may get "cold" there about 5 days a year.",

review_text: "I like São Paulo, but I don't love it. It's pretty boring in my opinion. Probably because I love Buenos Aires so much and it just does not compare. 

Also for the 4 months (September - January) I was there, it was cold, overcast, and rainy 85% of the days. It was pretty depressing!

Other than that, it's pretty safe overall for Latin America. Also, I really appreciate how people here take COVID more seriously than in a lot of other places in Brazil.

If I had to do it again, I would stay near Ibirapuera Park - it's so beautiful.",

Weather is pretty good, mild winters. bureaucracy isn't that bad, food quality here is some of the best in the world. Bad things: cost of living is insane, real estate prices are some of the most expensive in the world. People are generally friendly but I wouldn't say they are "open minded" or "warm" compare to other cultures. Has no real culture or much history. I think it's boring here. No much to do. Very isolated from rest of the world. Even if you have a high income I still think there are far better options. To visit though you will love it!",

As someone else said there are the commie block vibes, but those are in more peripheral neighborhoods. I felt it was safe, and had no issues getting around by tram mostly. As someone mentioned there is definitely the traditional Southern European cafes are for socializing, not working kind of vibe but still a decent number had wifi and didn't bat an eye at working all day.

The city was much more alive and vibrant than I had anticipated and I was pleasantly surprised by the number of cool places to eat, get coffee, etc. It's not huge and you'll get the lay of the land pretty quick, but it's easy to get around, I had good wifi both places I stayed (one was particularly excellent), and there was also some solid but unspectacular free wifi at various points in the city. Cheaper than Split or Dubrovnik, though obviously not as pretty and it did get pretty cold while I was there in October. Generally, I'd give it a thumbs up and wish I had a bit more time there.",

I've traveled in other Eastern Europe, but Zagreb felt really weird. And price-wise it's more expensive than other cities, while not giving much value for that.
I would probably not stay there again unless needed. Try Bratislava, Budapest, Prague, Sofia, Lubljana or anything else :)",

Taiwanese people are truly blessed, they're kind, honest and genuine.
There's a very cheap coffee-shop chain called "Louisa" cafe which is dirt cheap and has great set ups for nomads .
Highly recommended, Kaohsiung is cool too.

review_text: "I have been to many cities but I have been returning to Taipei the most. The keyword in my opinion is liveability. Although dense the city is relaxing. Turn off the main roads and you often find streets empty, especially during office hours. Small parks are everywhere, just as food stalls and a cheap bikes to cycle in between them. Like Tokyo you can find gems of cafe's and shops just by walking around. On the bustling side of things there are plenty night markets. And being a city with lots of students Tapei has got a proper night life too. Culturally, there is everything you can expect from a big city: cinema, festivals, music scenes, (hidden) cocktail bars and modern art venues. Within an hour outside Taipei you can reach the ocean and mountains. I also liked getting a cheap rental car and just touring the island. All-in-all Taipei has got a good balance between quiet places, nature and being a big, bustling city. It definitely hasn't got as many gems as Tokyo, as big of a food scene as Hong Kong or as big as a party scene as Bangkok but it does combine many of these things in a balanced manner. 


Few other thing I want to mention. Like others said the air quality can be brutal when the wind is coming from China. There are not many Western tourists so expect to feel a bit like Lost in Translation sometimes. There are lots of Japanese influences. The youth is very Western oriented and liberal. Still they life with parents until married. Stay in student houses if you can, it's cheap and social. The food is great but carbs based (lots of noodles!). Get some veggies from markets and eat some chicken/eggs from the 7Eleven to top up proteins. The insects are crazy. Butterflies are huge but so is other stuff.. If I could change Taipei I would also add more digital nomads and coworking spaces. Ok that's it!",

review_text: "Stayed here for 1 month in Da'An district. As a previous reviewer said, Taipei is a real hidden gem and really has the best of both worlds on many fronts. It's a very modern city with excellent public transportation and utilities, yet you can live here cheaply. It's also very laid back while also having many interesting things to see and do. The north and east coast of the island are especially worth visiting if you come here. Street food scene is incredible, some of the most interesting and diverse food I've tried anywhere in the world. People are also reasonably friendly, but without being fake. It helps to speak basic chinese here to get around, but is by no means a necessity. While Taipei is not for everyone (for example, it's probably not a great place if you're looking to party), it's certainly an amazing place to live and work while getting just enough culture shock without being uncomfortable. It was my favorite place to DN in asia by far.",

Safe, clean, good services, relatively cheap for the quality of living you can get here. 
Friendly people and attractive girls.
You walk out of the house, sun is shining with this cool tower in the skyline, you get your coffee, and some 7 eleven snack you go do some work.
As Pieter said, you get to hang out with cool taiwanese ppl, many studied and worked in USA, and in general open to foreigners. Always felt treated well.

For some reason, Taiwanese people don't think as highly of their country, but having seen the rest of the world, believe this is Heaven.

review_text: "I lived in 🇹🇼 Taiwan for 3 months. Here's my TL;DR on Taipei: great food, friendly people, mellow vibes, great for working, great infrastructure and slightly boring but in a good way. 

First thing (and I recommend everyone does this wherever they arrive ALWAYS), get a 4G SIM card. It's only 1000 TWD (or $33) for UNLIMITED 4G! And it's VERY fast. The only other country I know that has this for foreigners is South Korea.

Da'an is my favorite area. It's the center of Taipei for fashion, shopping, hipsters, mixed Taiwanese and foreigners a like. Da'an itself is pretty giant and it has lots of sub-neighborhoods with third wave coffee shops, boutique vintage fashion and lots of excellent (and cheap) Taiwanese and (not so cheap) Western food.

For Taiwanese, Da'an is supposedly expensive af. But internationally it really isn't. I had a good deal but I paid $23/night for a clean studio with bathroom right smack in the center. The more normal price would be $40/night. That's $1,200/month for an Airbnb. That means the rent is generally half here, so $600/month. As I said, that's pretty cheap to live in a really cool area. I was told houses here cost upwards of a million dollars. Okay.

Now, if you're not Taiwanese. You might already have been in contact with Taiwan in your daily life. Your iPhone is made in China, but by a company from here called Foxconn. You used to have a laptop that always broke and it was probably by a company from here called ASUS. You might not have an ASUS laptop but there's a 30% chance your laptop is still made by a Taiwanese company called Quanta, who actually makes the laptops sold by Dell, HP, Lenovo and Toshiba. Their microchips are great and they're probably in almost every electronic device you have made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC). This is most of their entire economy. It's high tech AF. And it's for a reason. They're smart AF too. They're the highest educated people in the world.

The fact that they're high-tech means that their internet is super fast and solid everywhere. Their 4G is also on-par with the best in the world, which is Korea. Generally, technology is approached just very proper in Taiwan. Government somehow gets it and most interfaces you'll use in Taiwan will work very very well.

So what's the vibe here? Culturally? Well, it's pretty unique. You can see the strong Japanese influence in their aesthetics. It's still here. Girls wear giant lenses to make their eyes look bigger (that's a predominantly Japanese thing) and their make up looks strongly Japanese, not at all Chinese. "Oh Pieter, why do you talk about how people look?". Well, because it's a pretty good indicator of their cultural influences.

Then there's that definite Western vibe. As in, people talk, move and behave very Western (unlike the rest of Asia). Now, there's not many foreigners here at all. So I can only presume that comes from the Taiwanese diaspora (that means people living outside the country), which is massive and predominantly in America. That means you get lots of American-born Taiwanese and Taiwanese studying and working in America. You know a few of them probably, like YouTube's co-founder Steve Chen and Yahoo's co-founder Jerry Yang.

Another thing is, it's a dense city but somehow it's not busy on the streets. There's so much space. I've never seen any crowds in the street in Taipei. That has a very calming effect.

Actually, yes, that's the keyword. Taipei is calm. It doesn't stress me out like Tokyo or Bangkok or (sometimes) Bali does. It's not loud here. It's not busy. People are mellow. I'd go as far to again call Taipei boring, but unlike when I was here 3 years ago, now I like that it's boring. It's boring in a good way.

There's one big thing that makes it hard to live in Taipei. The air is one of the most unhealthy in Asia.

And it's not so much their fault, but China's. When the wind blows east, China's pollution goes straight to Taiwan. But it doesn't pass over. Taiwan is pretty much an island that is half one big mountain that crosses it. And that mountain is so high it blocks the air pollution, so it gets stuck. I don't really know what you can do about this except blowing up that mountain. But that's probably unfavorable.

Here's my TL;DR on Taipei: great food, friendly people, mellow vibes, great for working, great infrastructure (like 4G, roads, etc.), slightly boring but in a good way.

The most important word though is, Taipei is mellow. Maybe boring. But in a good way.",

review_text: "I spent ten months in Guadalajara from roughly December 2020 to September 2021.
By the end, I personally had enough of being in a city, but it was nothing particular to Guadalajara compared to any other city of a comparable size. I really appreciated the cost of living here and the great vegan/vegetarian options for eating. I also greatly enjoyed the vast amounts of cheap fresh ripe fruit here like pitaya, en español “ tunas” a cactus fruit, coconuts, and mango. If you have access to a car, there are some beautiful canyons north of the city about 30 minutes. They’re especially beautiful during the rainy months. It’s also about 6 hours in a BlaBlaCar and less than 50 to go to puerto Vallarta or San Francisco on the beach. (second more recommended). If you stay in the northern/eastern parts of the city and the more well off areas, safety is never really a problem. The most I was wary of is getting my phone grabbed which happened to some friends while I was there. The basic rule of thumb is to not have valuables out in crowded areas and when using your phone, hold it with two hands close to your chest away from the street edges. I never felt like I was in physical danger or heard stories of any of my friends feeling like that. It is advisable to not go walking at night especially as a women. But I didn’t get the sense that it was especially dangerous to do so. Just generally a good idea. Talpalpa is a mountainous town outside of the city which was my favorite place to go to be in nature. It costs about 50 usd to hire a driver to go there. Flights around Mexico usually cost less than 100 usd. If you ever want to go to San Diego to or from, a tip is to head into tiajuana as it’s half the price in my experience. 

Beyond that, the yoga scene is surprisingly strong and there are an abundance of studios. There are some parks and a lot of the streets in the richer areas are lined with very old trees, but I personally felt a bit lacking in the nature area since I didn’t have access to a car. There is a strong expat community there. Check out the Mexpats group on Facebook to connect. Clubs are decent. Music scene is also decent.",

To avoid this, download an app that calculates the fare for you (prices are fixed and determined by the city)and show this to the driver before entering the taxi. Like in most major tourist destinations, there will be opportunists who will try to profit from your ignorance. Use your common sense.

What can I say? My first real estate agent scammed me for 1500TL. And I couldn't rent any apartment for 6 months because I am a single woman and also my national is being considered as not the one with decent women. So finally after 2 weeks of searching and meetings with many completely rude and unprofessionally real estate agents I did find the apartment.
What am I thinking about now? Yes, how to leave this city. The city centre is not clean, it's almost impossible to have a taxi, the electricity cuts off very frequently and i Never know when my remote work will be stopped. The city itself is overcrowded and despite living in the city center I am afraid to walk nearby at night.",

review_text: "Spent 4 months in Istanbul. Lovely city. Lots of things to do, cafes to work from, historical sites and nice parks. Might be chaotic at times but its part of its charm.

Pros:
Everything is really cheap from food, groceries, clothes, etc. The only unusually pricey thing is alcohol. Rent prices are skyrocketing too

I found Turkish people to be really nice. Some of them went out the extra mile to help me out with mundane things. The tea culture and community feeling of every street is awesome too!

Public transport is great. Make sure to live in a place close to a Metro/Marmaray/Metrobus station. I'd recommend staying in the European side, specially close to the Yenikapi station (M2)

Cons:

English is not widely spoken and it can be an issue if you don't speak turkish. You can have a hard time if you decide to live in 'authentic' turkish neighborhoods because finding people speaking English is hard. To avoid this simply stay in the european side, Taksim is where most foreigners hang out and people speak decent English

Watch out for scammers. They are everywhere in Taksim/Istiklal Street. 1 in 10 taxi drivers will try to swindle you. Not even Uber can protect you on this.",

Despite it being a touristy place, vendors are not aggressive. Locals are chill. Some shops would even round down our bill if they have no exact change. There was working WiFi in coffee shops but it was faster in our Airbnb of course and that's where we work. 

For transport, google is never reliable (sometimes yes). A local recommended us the app Moovit and it was accurate. Get an Istanbul card for the metro. They have really efficient public transport, comfortable and cheap! People are so nice they assisted us in buying the card when the vendor can't speak English. Locals are so helpful, you just have to look for the nice ones. And maybe be nice so people are also nice to you :)

Aside from the historical spots, it's a great place for food! They have a great coffee and tea culture too.",

People were rude 100% of the time, very hard to find someone who can speak english, uber just works with cash and price is not accurate, don't trust google maps for public transportation (it doesn't gives you all the routes and some bus routes were wrong), Internet was REALLY bad everywhere, you can't access wifi in public areas without a local sim card, SIM Card for tourists are way more expensive ...

If you're looking to make new friends, this is probably not your place to pick (as people are pretty cold), but if you want to enjoy your life, live in your own pace - go to islands to swim, see historical places, walk on your feet a lot, go to cool restaurants and very vivid coffee shops (the variety, is wow!!).

review_text: "Sarajevo is a fantastic city that offers much to those who visit with an open mind and a willingness to engage with the local people and culture. It compares extremely favourably to other capital cities in the region and more generally, as it open, accessible (it is a small city) and low-cost. It is relatively straightforward to find accommodation (also seek local guidance on this and all other economic interactions) and costs of living are generally low. Local people are friendly and also keen to engage with internationals, which provides a welcome alternative to Croatia, for example, where you are more likely to be treated as tourist fodder. I would be interested to hear more about how Sarajevo is Islamifying, as in my experience this is not definitely not the case. Islam is practised here (along with other religions, as Sarajevo has a long-established tradition of religious tolerance and diversity) by an Islamic community who are clearly distinct from the largely secular society. This applies in Sarajevo to exactly the same extent as it applies in London (my home capital) and any tolerant, open, inclusive city. Setting this aside, Bosnia's Islamic community appear comparatively more 'modernised' and 'progressive' than separate religious communities in the Islamic world or other religious communities within the region. The war, which ended 25 years ago, is still an important part of the city's present: both Sarajevo and the wider country are still struggling to recover and I would encourage readers to take this into account when making judgements/demands about working spaces or the resources available to internationals more generally.",

The city itself is a wonderful mix of Western and Eastern cultures, and you can sample architecture from the Ottoman period, Austo-Hungarian period, as well as the Yugoslav period. It is a cosmopolitan city, with a mix of Catholic, Muslim, Orthodox and Jewish religions. It has a great caffe culture with many different cafes all across the city. The central and old town areas are the most interesting to both live and work. Amazing mountains, for the outdoorsy types are just minutes away. If you are a fan of hiking, the mountains surrounding Sarajevo and elsewhere across Bosnia will offer you an unforgettable experience. There are several co-working places, with new ones seemingly coming up every year. I've been spending time in Sarajevo for the past three years on and off. I would definitely recommend coming in late spring through summer and early fall. The winters can be harsh, and the city covered in fog and smog which is not fun (sometimes the airport closes due to the density of fog). In August there is a phenomenal film festival - SFF - which lasts for a week and is a Mecca for filmophiles and party animals alike. Should definitely not be missed. The beautiful town of Mostar is a mesmerizing two hour drive from Sarajevo and also has much character and history.
The cost of living is relatively inexpensive and you can find decent accommodation for very reasonable amounts. Eating out is also cheap with many different offerings. If you are a vegetarian or vegan, you may find it slightly more challenging as Bosnia and the Balkans in general are very meat intensive in their cuisine.
If you are based in the center or old part of town, walking everywhere is easy and convenient. Taxis are also cheap. There are enough decent gyms for exercise that are relatively inexpensive, as well as trails for jogging. Biking is also popular in the summer months, especially mountain biking and you can easily find people and crews to join in on tours.",

Spent a week at a private finca near Guia de Isora and really enjoyed what I saw of that area. Seemed like there was lots to do in nearby Playa San Juan. Stayed another week in Puerto de la Cruz which didn't have a whole lot going on despite seeming to be a popular destination for tourists. Still a beautiful place to explore on foot for a few days.Weather seems to be pretty much flawless year round. My hotel room in Puerto de la Cruz (Coral Teide Mar) was pretty nice and super affordable ($34/night). Food around town was just ok.The biggest highlight of the trip was taking an interpretive hike with a guide around the base of Teide. Got to see some stunning views above the cloud line and learned a lot about the geology and natural history of the islands. I would highly recommend exploring the volcanoes with someone who can explain why it's all so cool.If I could do it again, I think I'd spend all my time in the south/west areas of the island.Pro tip: there are cannabis clubs scattered all around the island, but most don't do any advertising because they don't want to attract tourists (technically you're only allowed to get in if you're a resident). There is one in Puerto de la Cruz called The Bud Company that you can find on Instagram and Weedmaps. You can email or DM and ask to join the club, and as long you're chill they'll instruct you on how to proceed. Good luck finding the place! 😂☠️ Look for `Edificio Belitope` on Google Maps and pay close attention to the photo of the door on Weedmaps. You're welcome.",

Unfortunately it was too cold to swim in the ocean. Some people did, but it's definitely not comfortable, water is just cold and the overall temperature is in the 20 degrees Celsius range, so it was not hot by any measure. The place is filled with British retirees and Eastern European tourists. There are just a few stores, one 24/7 off license and one Lidl store. The availability of goods is limited. As for dining, it's ok, but nothing to write home about. Housing is meh. Despite being small and sparsely populated it managed to be loud. As for the scenery, apart from palm trees and a few patches of grass maintained within the town, it is barren land. Essentially a piece of rock sticking out of the ocean. I've heard it's greener in the North.Maybe there are interesting people to meet in more popular areas like La Playa las Americas, but where I was at it felt empty, boring, and mediocre.

My thoughts are belowPros: - Lovely weather at this time of year, really pleasant in the low 20s - The island has lots to see and some of the national parks are just spectacular. There's so much beauty on the island- It's relatively cheap, so a nice modern Airbnb in the centre of Santa Cruz for instance will set you back 1300-1500 EUR- WiFi is very good in the Airbnbs so no problem there, was able to take video calls easily and it never cut outCons: - I struggled to find a good meal in Puerto de la Cruz whilst I was there for a month. I wasn't the only one it seems, as I had another couple approach me to ask about the food in the restaurant I was eating at and they said all the places they had tried were terrible. - Online dating is much harder than other places I've been to (I spent all my time in North Tenerife FYI), and I think the level of English amongst the locals might have something to do with it. I didn't have a single date in the months I was here, compared to having lots of dating experiences in many different countries. - Really no decent places to work from outside of your apartment. Cafes in the centre will have dodgy WiFi (if any at all) and the coffee in general isn't that great in my opinion.",

The island has so much to offer; dramatic nature hikes, good food, excellent weather, fun parties/raves (yes, even during covid times), water sports, beaches, etc. The general vibe is very chill and it's easy to talk with both locals and tourists. Everyone is simply having a good time. There´s a reason this island is so popular among tourists.At the same time, the island's popularity is also its achilles heel. Once countries opened uptheir borders again and tourists started flooding in around June, the quality of living went down dramatically. Hard to find parking, beaches overcrowding, drunk people on the streets (Las Americas), prices increasingly steeply etc. I honestly wouldn´t want to spend a full-on non-corona summer here, even though it is possible to avoid them, for instance by sticking to the north side of the island.My recommendation would be to visit Tenerife as a digital nomad, in off-season times only. For me personally, 2.5 months was enough to see and do most of the things there, and I don't feel the need to come back per se. Most Digital Nomads I met were also staying somewhere between 1-4 months before moving off again. And that´s completely fine of course :)",

The South has better weather and more touristy vibe, the North is colder but with more long-term people.

Seems to be a good solution for those who have to remain in EU timezones or just starting out they nomad journey and don't want to take too much risk.- Awesome weather.- Nature. Surfing, kitesurfing, diving, hiking, mountain biking and all kinds of outdoor activities are great on the island.- Decent public transport, nice roads, generally good infrastructure.Cons:- Zero hipster cafes that are good for work.- Very few co-working spaces.- No ride-hailing apps. You have to make a phone call to book a taxi like it's 2005. Best to get a car or motorbike.- Online shopping can be a hassle due to the distance from the mainland.- Difficult to find high quality accommodation, even if you have the money to burn.- Lots of drunk retired British expats and businesses catering for them.Overall, I think Tenerife is great and has great potential at becoming an "European" nomad hotspot -- if it isn't one already.",

It is not too hot and sometimes partly cloudy and still it is green and very calm and quiet. The Finca is in San Juan de la Rambla (Hotel Finca San Juan) and provides super fast 600 MBit fiber with strong WIFI broadcast on the whole premise. It consists of some complexes to rent for long-term with a huge discount and a lot of included Services. It has many chillout areas to withdraw and even isolate a bit. Also it has a big pool and showers, restaurant, bar and a projector to give seminars. The island is full of other facilities to live and work, but I like this the most and I will stay here until end of February. Hit me a message to Dave Travolta in one of the social networks. I am usually up for brainstorming session or social drink.",

The people we met were nice, the weather was fantastic, prices for things were reasonable, good selection of locally grown produce, good internet connectivity, there were lots of outdoor activities to do, and not too touristy or crowded (at least Santa Cruz in January). Other parts of the Island felt more resort-like and it wasn't so easy to get to places outside of Santa Cruz without a car.",

Not many hipsters, but overloaded with instagrammers (like everywhere else, I guess). All in all, it's a beautiful city, safe, affordable, welcoming (if you are white).

review_text: "Insane ... which is why everyone has either left or is leaving. I lived there for over 15 years, and in the past 2 years, the prices for AirBNB has gone up 200-500% on the apartments with many being removed from AirBNB due to the government changes. I had to visit this year for work and spent 7 weeks in hotels and AirBNB for the meetings I had with clients ... cost ... over 16k in accommodation and living expenses ... but that is July and August in Barcelona now. Seems like the Americans, Russians, and northern Europeans have made the city more expensive than Dubai. Internet in the summer is poor (I should know I have a team of 8 designers living there in tiny apartments). Madrid is about half the price and is the capital of Spain ... how does that make any sense when the beach in Barcelona and within 100km of Barcelona are not even worth visiting? Startups are leaving in droves due to the shift to remote working and the fact that most skilled workers are leaving Spain completely alone. Wages are poor in respect of European rates so working for a client there is fine temporarily to fill in the gaps but not in the long term, having said that Spain is still higher than Portugal and Greece ... just. Food is good and plenty of healthy options in the city. Amazon is amazing there and very easy to topup your gadgets. Apple is about 100-200 euros more expensive than Dubai and elsewhere and the keyboards are not real English or US so shortcuts don't work on Macs the same way. Service is ok at best in bars, and ok in most restaurants. Try not to order anything from the sea at the moment as the prices have tripled in the last 2 years. Car rental is possible with full insurance at 1k per month, so you can stay in Gerona if you wish, which is a cheaper option, and even Reus or Tarragona to the south. With the 90 day (UK) visa you can add Barcelona to your weekend list as on a weekend you can cover most of the things you need to do or see. Be careful of the police in Spain as they are a law unto themselves, keep away from them as much as you can. There is still lots of thefts on the metro so keep your hands in your pockets on your wallet and phone at all times. Be very careful of the Rambla area, Reval and Golic as it is full of pickpocketers at the moment recovering from COVID by taking advantage of the bewildered newcomers that have been locked up safe in their homes. Shopping is getting worse year on year and even the larger chain retailers are moving out of Spain and Barcelona due to the lack of spendable money by the locals who are being squeezed out of the city. Expat community? There was one, but it is now down to an irregular meetup using the Nationals website mainly focused on singles and Latin Americans looking for a husband. All in all ... Barcelona has become an interesting weekend visit if you can avoid the stag and hen parties.",

review_text: "Lived in Barcelona for a year and a half. I would agree that the weather is perfect and Barcelona does have a great tech scene as well as food and has everything landscape and lifestyle wise that you could think of. Bureaucracy isn't too bad if you nip it in the bu** early and have patience. Also, some clubs are free. (Jamboree!). The metro is also, very efficient with red and purple being the busiest lines. Very walkable city too. Plenty of opportunity to meet people as well. The beaches are ok, just avoid Barceloneta as it's pretty gross and you WILL get bugged by vendors and pick pockets. Not really any violent crime unless there is a reason for it. But ok, time for the negatives. Crime... it is not super dangerous I never felt unsafe. However, I almost got jumped twice and had gotten pickpocketed 3 times. One timed almost jumped because I was waiting for the night bus in a certain neighborhood (Reval) and the bus was taking forever. Once, I had two women of the night ;) sit next to me while waiting for the metro like, on both sides while noone else was there. And almost pick pocketed while on the metro going in run and dash method. Nothing ever happened or taken because I played it smart and didn't do any dumb tourist things but please be careful. Keep your cell phone in your FRONT pocket. Keep things in a secret pocket and don't put anything of importance in the front pockets of a backpack even if you hold it up front they have their ways lol. Also, Barcelona is mostly smoke and mirrors vibe wise. A lot of things you think are amazing or authentic are built purely for tourism and not authentic. Like, the "Gothic Quarter" for example. You can also entertain all of your vices here as well. Just be very very careful as Barcelona can swiftly drag you in and under. The Catalan people are courteous but not warm or friendly. If you want to thrive here you must learn Spanish AND Catalan. The only spanish speakers that are friendly are people from outside of Cataluyna but, quickly become on of them if from Spain so, your only bet are those from Latin America. And yeah, Barcelona is family friendly no problem. Just don't live in the Reval area unless you want break-ins. It's considered a hip place though despite that. And as a single person renting a room and using Cafe Wifi and going out for a drink once a week and buying bare minimal groceries; I would say I could live off of 700 euros bare minimum which, is kind of not enough if you ask me but it was ok. I could have found a cheaper room (Mine was 430 euros) but, alas I was desperate. However, Barcelona is amazing, with an art scene that is cool, a skater's paradise if that's your scene and many more. Just don't do dumb tourist things.",

The leisure activities outside Munich (nature) are nice, unfortunately there is not much going on in the city compared to London, Berlin or Barcelona. In Germany, everyone seems to want to go to Berlin, so if you don't, I recommend looking at Hamburg or Cologne - but unfortunately not Munich.",

It is a great place to live generally, offering high quality of life, and it would hands down be the best city to live in Germany if:
-It wasn't expensive af, especially rent prices
-It wasn't almost impossible to find a place to rent (like literally the only way to find is through acquaintances)
-Bavaria was less bureaucratic and more tech-progressive
-It had more... young people; much of the youth there is because of the two of the best unis in Germany (LMU & TUM) that receive 
many EU & International students, otherwise it would have been a city of old people.

Everything else is pretty much great in Munich, which is quite liberal in an otherwise conservative state.",

It's a very calm city and often not so much going on in the summers as all students are on holiday.

Overall you might have a hard time making friends but if you join the co-working space in the center, meetups and language exchanges you should be good. It's even easier if you know German as people don't speak such good English here. If you go here I recommend getting a bike and checking out the parks and also go canoeing near the river.",

review_text: "Bengaluru, January 4-9, and 13-13, 2020. Had a good time in Bengaluru ( formerly Bangalore). At first I stayed at the Parijatha Gateway Hotel, Near Soap Factory Metro, which was ideal for my purposes. Transit & shopping was nearby, and there was a mall and good food. The Metro in BLR is VERY modern and smooth- be prepared to be patted down (women and men separately) to get into the station, and you can but a metrocard at the ticket window. In Bangalore the internet is VERY fast (it is India's Silicon Valley) and every other person is an engineer... and can chat you up in multiple languages.( their English may be better than yours :). Uber works well inside the city, but I advise a pre-paid taxi from the airport to your hotel (as flagging down your Uber at the airport is a bit difficult because of the congestion there). Now, lets talk about traffic- I have lived in NYC and I can say with authority that, yes, Bangalore has the worst traffic congestion I have ever seen. Any time that Google maps gives you to get anywhere by Auto or bus in Bangalore can be Doubled or Tripled to get the actual time of transit- you can't make this sit up... I am not kidding. All that aside, I never felt unsafe in Bangalore. 

Food in Bangalore is varied and tasty... You will have a good variety of Vegetarian and non-vegetarian options available to you. I did not seek out the night life, but there sure are some fancy upscale places if you want them.

My second stay ion the trip was at the Conrad Hilton, which is in a class all by itself but not your everyday Nomad kind of place (My expenses were being covered for that, the price per night is insanely low by western standards, and so if you need some amazing pampering for a night or two, this is your go-to place) . Internet was fast, staff was attentive, scenery can't be beat. Uber back to the airport was easy.

I will return to Bengaluru in the future.",

Bengaluru is located at the foot of the Western Ghats, on the Deccan Plateau. The city is often referred to as the "Silicon Valley of India" and "IT Capital of India" because of the large number of information technology companies that were established in the city in the last decade. The city is also referred to as the "Pensioner's Paradise" because of the large number of pensioners that reside in the city.

At the same time, I think the city gets monotonous fast compared to other places where I lived in a similar size. Estonian people don't appear to be very active. It's understandable because most of them are hard-working and outside of the tech-scene lots of people and students work two jobs.
It is not so international, and flight connections are not so many. It's also harder to make friends compared to other cities. Additionally, it's getting more and more expensive.

The entire city was very walkable, there were cafes and pubs and restaurants just a few doors down (I was near St Olaf's Church), to no more than 10 minutes away by foot. Uber and others were no more than 2 or 3 minute wait. Definitely go check out the memorial to Estonia's victims of communism or the former KGB prison cells. Very sobering.",

It is hard to do anything without getting the heaven or hell service experience. Trying to get a private office or private space in the shared work areas, has been a huge letdown with many being unavailable for months. The cafe's are not work friendly, as you have to deal with cigarette smoke and loud music, crowded spaces. A lot of bars and restaurants close over the summer months (July-August) as they go on holiday. The people individually are friendly, but the service is very bad.",

review_text: "I'm living in Belgrade for last 15ish years, and as every large city, there are some pros and cons. I've learned from experience that if you're dissapointed with something in a particular city - it just means that you haven't searched enough, or you were misguided. Most of european cities are sharing a lot of similarities, so I'll try to focus only on differences.

1. Night life - in Belgrade, it's unbeatable by far. There is so much variety on that topic, and it just depends on you what are you searching for. It's true that sometimes it's not easy to find information over the internet on public sites, it's better to know local people to guide you through. There are even locals who cannot recommend you something good for night life because they are not in that mood anymore, they don't know what's popular nowadays. That's quite common, at least with mid-aged people.

2. Food - You can really find any type of food you want, from all around the world. If you're foody, you're on the right place - no matter if you want domestic food, or something international.

3. Moderately cheap - This is sort of true, although prices are going up last few years, so it's not that cheap anymore. The rest of Serbia is a lot cheaper than capital of course.

4. Hospitality - This is usually on very high-level here, but you cannot judge on it based on bars/restaurants in city center which are full of tourists. I'm having feeling all across the globe that you're not served properly in any country if you're sitting in very touristic place, especially if waiters are overloaded, and they cannot pretend that they have enough energy for everyone. But still, such experiences are rare minorities, everyone care about reviews.

5. From safety standpoint, I'll tell you one fact - how many capital cities in the world you know where it's safe to go freely over the night in every area of the city? I'm not sure I know for some, every city has some regions where it's not clever to go by walk over the night. Well, guess what, we don't have such places. You can go wherever you want over the night, and you'll feel safe. Of course that something randomly might happen, but it's very very rare.

6. Medical - Medical tourism is pretty popular here, but specifically for two things: dentists and plastic surgery. That's something you can do here with very affordable prices. Other than that, I don't see a reason why someone would come here for any other medical service.

What I don't like in Belgrade is:
1. Transportation - Our public transport is bad, lack of metro. Even taxis are very booked, and sometimes it's not easy to find one, although there are a lot of those in the city. Traffic in the city might be a bit tough for someone who is coming from Germany/Switzerland, but trust me - you haven't been in Palermo / Sicily. Belgrade is something in between of those two.
2. Pollution - It's true that situation is not great, specifically during winter time. I wouldn't recommend coming here during winter time if you're asthmatic.
3. Globalization - In last few decades, it's evident that city is transforming to something "acceptable" from the "western" standpoint, meaning it's having all those popular places and franchizes which you can find all over the global. All the capital cities in Europe are starting to be like all the others. Cities are losing its character. I'm not a fan of modern skyscrapers neither.

Bottom line - try to find a local people for recommendations if you want to get the most juice of visiting Belgrade.",

Also, overall it's not a very transient place and everyone knows each other, and it seems like in Serbian culture there is a sort of stigma in associating with outsiders. 

Other Slavic countries are not like this, I think it is something specific to Serbian culture. One Serbian-American friend says it has a lot to do with many young people leaving Serbia, and the media being taken over by the government and promoting a nationalist narrative. I don't know if that's true but I doubt I will be back, except for the purpose of medical tourism -- the medical care here is cheap and of very high quality, much higher than other non-Schengen European countries.",

review_text: "I was born and raised in Belgrade and all I can say is the city is very underrated. Been to many major cities in Europe, Northern Africa, and also lived for half a year in Los Angeles. I don't wanna sound as if I'm a big local patriot. I will try to be as much as genuine as possible.


I completely agree with the fact that most places are full of smoke from cigarettes yet there are parts of the objects separated from smoking sections. This is available in many restaurants, cafes, bars, etc. You don't have to inhale smoke if you don't wish to. Also, one review on here complains about the highest lung cancers in this area -- I must admit this is not 100% accurate based on the statistics. You can't be sure about that info especially if considering that many places, in both country and the capital, left contaminated since the 1999 NATO bombing back. So it makes sense seeing rates being high within one part of the population. However, it's not an excuse for smokers and a bad living style.


The nightlife is somewhat lower due to the Covid-19 crisis and local law regulations. Again, this doesn't mean all famous discos and bars are completečy gone. The riverside is still flawing with clubbing and you can have a great time if you know the right place to go.


Now when it comes to people, local people here are very open and generous to foreigners. Hospitality is simply a part of our culture and we've known for this in the Balkans as well as the rest of Europe. We are also famous for helping people no matter where they come from. One of the reviews mentioned that waitresses will usually prefer to read a book or stare at their phones -- again, it also depends on the place you go, and in most cases, you will end up meeting a very friendly local waitress who will dive into a conversation with you whether you are a foreigner coming from abroad or a local pal that got lost in a different area. "Coffee culture" is very famous here and also a part of our culture. You can easily find a friend who will go out with you to a cafe or bar. In my opinion, the major difference between this part of the world and western society world is the fact people here are more honest and will not fake their feelings. This is why you will see dozens of different moods. In the western world, this is somewhat faked and one of the things I disliked. You will also make deep friendships here because people aim to make meaningful relations (not faked).


In the last few years, the city has developed into a huge economic and IT hub. It has become an important place in this part of Europe (i.e. Ex Yugoslavia region to be more exact). There are lots of different places and activities you can do depending on your needs -- from walking in the parking zones and the riverside to hiking in smaller forest areas (I recommend Banjica forest). Most of the city center is walkable and turned into a walking zone -- you can easily walk away from the very center to the river. Also, the infrastructure is getting much better and even I can feel that for the 25 years spent here.


To summarize, if you want to feel the real European vibe for a cheaper price (western standards), then this is a place to go. I also recommend staying in urban areas closer to the city center because this part has a special vibe easily noticed. The suburban parts of the city may seem way too different for foreigners and remind them of a typical Eastern European environment.",

The city is not particularly walkable, the infrastructure is in a sad state, and there is practically no interesting architecture or urban development to speak of, be it historical, communist, or contemporary.

Pollution is a real problem. To make matters worse, people smoke all the time, everywhere, including inside every cafe and restaurant.

Health statistic confirm the point:
- 2nd highest rate of lung cancer in the world
- 4th highest rate of all cancer in the world
- 1st highest rate of pollution-related deaths in Europe
- 9th highest rate of pollution-related deaths in the world

People in Serbia are hospitable but if they do not know you by common friends or something they will treat you as an outsider in most cases, they will talk to you but not make friends etc.

Even for serbs from other cities when you go to another city, Belgrade for example, it is difficult to make friends or people to go out with . It applies much more to foreigners. Why? I do not know, we are very hospitable in general but that's the way it is.
Nightlife is not as good as it was, but it is good. Much better than in most of Europe. Cafes, restaurants and typical european culture is present at lower prices than for example in Denmark. 
The women are beautiful, some are stunning, I can say serbian women are among top 5 in Europe (along with russian, ukrainian, chech etc), men are often tall and good looking. 
Belgrade and Serbia are worth a visit especially if you are not from Europe and you can not afford more expensive western cities, but want to feel european lifestyle. In terms of hospitality, and good looking men and women you will get more then you would get in western Europe.",

To be honest, while i've traveled somewhat extensively, and leave the USA on average three times per year, I had no idea what to expect in Serbia (Belgrade). I'd never been to Eastern Europe, let alone the Balkans. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at how incredibly friendly just about everyone was. Everyone spoke english everywhere I went: cafes, restaurants, supermarket, taxis, shops, etc. My friend has very small children, and Belgrade is FULL of parks. The parks are routinely teeming with parents, as it seems there's some sort of a baby boom going on there. I was able to easily strike up friendly conversation with locals, who were extremely cordial. Even though I was there to visit friends, I spent the majority of my time alone exploring. I stayed in the city center, close to Republic Square. From there I could walk just about anywhere; the river, the mall on the other side of the river, waterfront, the old fort, etc. Taxis were extremely cheap, but often I just preferred to walk, even to Vracar from where I was in Venac , which is about a 30 minute walk, just because it was nice to experience Belgrade and people watch along the way. The AirBnb I rented had a functioning kitchen, and food in the supermarket is pretty cheap, but so is eating out (by American standards). I routinely had lunch or dinner with a drink, coffee and desert for anywhere from $11-18USD on average. I chose mostly to sit at any one of the countless open air cafe/restaurants twice a day, because it was so worth it. Is Belgrade the most exciting place on the planet? Probably not. At the same time, it's not boring either. I ended up loving the place. Between the people, the fact that I felt completely safe walking around by myself past midnight on many occasions, the great food, and typically European feel, I would definitely recommend Belgrade. Especially if you're not on a London/Paris budget, but want to experience Europe. People are much nicer also.",

review_text: "A lovely city. But not the friendliest one.

I travel extensively; 15-20 counties in the last 2 years. I'm friendly and very outgoing. But in my humble opinion, Belgrade (very generally speaking) is not a terrible friendly place for foreigners or solo-travelers.

It is a beautiful, inexpensive and very safe city. Prices are fantastic, as is the food. But unless you come here with a companion...be prepared to have a rather lonely time. The local Serbs are not rude or actively unpleasant, and most everyone speaks English well.

But most of the locals don't seem particularly open to having conversations with people they don't already know. 

In most of my travels, simply by being a foreigner in a cafe, restaurant or bar...you will, at minimum, at least be able to strike up a conversation with, say, your bartender or waitress. Here in Belgrade...not so much. For example: if you're sitting at the bar in a pub...the bartender, given a choice, will usually prefer to read a book or stare at their phone, rather than conduct anything more than a brief, monosyllabic conversation. It's pretty much the same in shops, restaurants, etc. And if you're used to striking up friendly conversations with fellow patrons at a restaurant, or bar, or art exhibition...don't expect that in Belgrade.

Even the cashiers in the local grocery stores seem to prefer to keep interactions as brief as possible. Fake as it may be, there is something a bit comforting about the Western retail-facade of people pretending to be happy to see a customer...especially when you encounter the absolute lack of it for weeks on end.

I'm not saying it's good or bad; it's just the way things are. I suspect it's at least somewhat cultural. I've gotten somewhat similar vibes in a few places in the Balkans and Eastern Europe before. I would not rate the locals of Budapest or Kiev as overly-friendly to outsiders, for instance...yet I found it far, far easier to meet and talk to people in those cities than in Belgrade.

There are exceptions to the above. But I will stand by it as an accurate generalization, having been in the city for 3 weeks. Perhaps if you hook up with other travelers in some of the city's co-work-spaces, you might have a better time; I don't know.

PS: I also think the "Belgrade is famous for it's nightlife" reputation is severely over-rated. That reputation might have been appropriate in the past; I heard from a couple of locals that, as of a year or so ago, a lot of new laws were passed restricting the operating-hours of most bars and clubs in the city. Most (not all, but definitely) places in the downtown area close up by midnight or 1am at the latest.

With the exception of a couple of specific nightclubs...most of the city is pretty much a ghost town by midnight, even on the weekends.

Again...a beautiful city, with lots of interesting culture, art and architecture. I think I'd likely love it if I came with someone I was dating. But for a solo traveler...it's genuinely one of the least-friendly cities I've ever been to.",

Ericeira is amazing, and beautiful, our favorite place, but they need more grassy patches for dogs, with baggies and trash. They also need a cleanup crew like in downtown Lisbon to wash the poo and poo streaks off the cobblestone. It's very dangerous to walk your own shoes into your home, especially if you have kids who will then contract flesh-eating bacterias from feces, such as Staphylococcus Aureus. Too many people will just let their dogs defecate right in the middle of the walkways, and just walk away not even batting an eye. Even those who do pick up after their dogs, it leaves a nice streak, which then hardens into the ground for weeks, eventually turning into a layer of brown dust that covers the sidewalks. 

Other than this, I highly recommend Ericeira. It's one of the best places to live in Portugal. They just need to start being responsible with da poo.",

If you're looking to move there also remember there's no central heating in most buildings, so if it's winter time, it's gonna be cold.

review_text: "I spent 11 days here. I like it a lot. Beaches, affordable, interesting architecture. Cool place and I could spend a summer here easily if I had a friend. Though, if you're single it wouldn't be hard to make one, as people here are amazing looking. 

I like the park a lot, and it has some interesting museums. Not a big hipster scene if that's your thing. More tourists, mostly from Bulgaria, Russia and Turkey. 

Nightlife is... okay. Mostly mafia and gypsy bars. But I do love this one bar called Cubo, on the beach. Great place. Very reasonable prices. Cheap actually. 
Nice place that needs more hype. 

I don't like that there's no ride hailing apps, and Google maps doesn't tell bus schedules. So transportation sucks. But most stuff is walking distance or a short bus ride, once you figure it out.",

The only downside is the cold weather in january and february. Other than that it's a pretty great place. Better than Sofia, any day.",

review_text: "Generally favorable on Antalya, but not perfect. The weather was excellent (~26 C almost every day) and the nature of the city is absolutely stunning. The mountains on the west side of the city seem to just explode out of the ocean and it's special to see. That said, the built environment is pretty uninspiring. The center of the city is full of interesting restaurants and shops, but outside of the old town it's not very exciting to look at. My primary complaint, however, is on public transit. It's easy to use the tram to get to/from the airport and bus station, but outside of those destinations you better be ready to walk (or use a cab, which I try to never do). Wifi was solid but I did have some drops here and there, my apartment was decent, and the city felt pretty safe. It's also incredibly cheap. I tend to be very frugal, so take this with a grain of salt, but you can easily get a quality meal for about $4 US and would have no problem getting an awesome meal for $8 US. Overall, I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't have wanted to stay much longer than the two weeks I was there.",

review_text: "i wanted to reply to one of the review that gave 3/5 to Antalya. I think Antalya deserves much better! It's a huge city of 2million inhabitants and it still feel super great because of the nature, the parks, the mountains, the sea, the culture, etc. It's true that locals don't really speak English but they are super nice and try to communicate with you the way they can. For taxi, there is literally taxi buttons every few meters in all the streets: you click on the button, and a taxi is coming withing a minute. For internet, you should buy the simcard in the city center, it's gonna be cheaper than at the airport. Btw Wikipedia is not blocked in 2020. You have many food and cafe options, after traveling the world Antalya is one of the best places I've been. One thing though: it needs a bigger digital nomad community and better coworking spaces.",

1) Not much in terms of co-working options. Feels like there are just a few options there. I found one coworking space, but honestly doesn't feel like a nomad place
2) Too few people speak English. It's really a struggle to communicate.
3) Feels too slow sometimes
4) No ridesharing apps. Literally. The only option is to book traditional taxis.
5) Internet is slow, including Airbnb's
6) Mobile internet plans are expensive. Not worth it.
7) VPN is a must. Wikipedia is blocked, for example.

On a flip side:
1) Airbnb's are cheap
2) Many options to go in the mountains, etc. Beautiful place.
3) Has a potential to grow

Overall 3/5 I would say. Not bad, but there are better places for nomads.",

review_text: "Korea's second biggest city after Seoul. Busan is a nice place to go if you want to see another part of Korea that's still pretty comfortable. It's in the south of South Korea, on the ocean, and that makes it a great place to eat fish. In fact that's where all the fish in Seoul comes from, so you can eat it fresh in Busan! In many ways Busan feels like Seoul but 10 or 20 years ago. It's a bit more grimy and broken down and less futuristic than Seoul, but still very nice. I'd suggest staying in Seomyeon, which is kinda like Seoul's Hongdae. It's a student area with some hipster vibes to it. But take hipster vibes with a grain of salt, this is Busan after all. People are very friendly, even more friendly than Seoul. Where in Seoul as a foreigner they don't really care anymore, in Busan you're still hailed as a curiosity which can be fun! If you want to see the beach, take a taxi to Haeundae Beach. It's especially nice in the evening if you'd like to party. Korean beach culture is a bit different than in the West, so you'll probably see less swimming and sunbathing that you're used to. More like people walking on the beach boulevard. Also nice is to see the Jagalchi fish market, pick some fish you like in the big building and you can ask them to prepare it for you upstairs and cook it. Fish as fresh as you can get in Korea.",

Public transit is absolutely horrendous. People can be a bit close-minded. Quality of life is otherwise comparable to other big NA cities. Taxes are on the low side. It's very out of the way - there's no real reason to come here as a tourist because Calgary is closer to everything interesting.",

Work culture is American, so expect high workload and 2-3 weeks off in a year.

People are polite but not really friendly. Dating is challenging but heavily depends on your preferences. Most young people are from India and Asia or second generation Asians. Some are from Latin America, and very few are from Europe. Cost of living is very high, while salaries are almost half of what you get in America. Local purchasing power is low. The city itself is filled with home challenged people and screaming crazies, but overall it is pretty clean and safe. They scream but don't attack basically. People are dressed either in expensive clothes or sweatpants, so mostly British dress code culture.

Healthcare is difficult to access unless you're dying because of long wait times.

The city is very spread out, so meeting people is difficult. Too many cars everywhere, narrow congested streets. Everybody is in a hurry somewhere. Commute is pretty bad anywhere. The subway system isn't great compared to other cities because parts of it shut down all the time and the reach isn't quite there. People don't really go for a walk here, so the streets are either packed with commuters to work or pretty empty.",

These people clearly haven't travelled much. Not saying it's cheap, but for a big city in an English speaking country it's about what you'd expect, if not cheaper.

Pros:
- Hot humid summers, gorgeous orange autumns, cold snowy winters. If you like distinct seasons this is a great place to be. Winter is about 4-5 months, from Nov-Mar. Ignore everyone telling you it's 7+, total lie. 
- Lots of cool little neighbourhoods
- Nice beaches that are actually in the city
- Legal weed
- Insanely multicultural
- Great tenant rights (no security deposits and landlords can't stop you having pets)
- Public transport is decent by North American standards
- Good local salaries (though still way less than the US)
- Cottage country
- Loads of events going on
- If you embrace winter you can have a lot of fun in the snow, ice skating, skiing etc.

Cons:
- People are pretty cold and hard to connect with
- Big issue with people with serious mental health issues roaming the streets, like pretty much every city in NA
- Everywhere outside of the downtown core is insanely boring
- Nightlife is tame. If you like a few drinks in a bar it's good. If you like a proper night out you're better off visiting Montreal
- Groceries are expensive as hell
- Public transport is bad by European standards
- Job market is extremely competitive due to mass immigration",

Downside is a lot of the restaurants aren't open and some tours are shut down. Upside is you get to live like a local in a insanely touristy town 10 months of the year. We were able to grab a very nice 1 bedroom apartment in the old town center with a kitchen for 150 euros for 5 nights (30 euros/n). Probably 10-15 restaurants were open in the old town, including the main grocery store. It appeared most everything was getting ready to open for Carnival, which probably marks the end of the lowest season (Few days after New Year's to Carnival). We did all the touristy stuff, and saw no other International travelers but a few random couples and one Chinese tour bus that overnighted (Right as COVID was taking hold...) We walked the walls and saw less than 20 people in 2 hours. If you want to avoid the crowds you can't beat Dubrovnik in the winter.",

review_text: "1. Dubrovnik is in Republic of Croatia and Croatia is among FIRST SIX COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD that legally regulated 12 month visas for Digital nomads.
2. When this Town (under name of Ragusa) was independent state it was The first country in the world that officially recognize independency of the USA. Historic heritage of this town is enormous so there is plenty amazing things to see and learn.
3. During last year Dubrovnik was almost COVID-19 FREE ZONE with extra small numbers of infections and deaths.
4. Local inhabitants fluently speak English and German and are good in Italian or French. Foreign languages are learnt from grade school up to the University. 
5. All major internet providers, bank offices, exchange offices and lot of ATMs are present in the city.
6. Credit cards and POS machines are present in almost every shop, caffe, restaurant and taxi.
7. Food is very tasty and often made from local vegetables and fresh fish and shells. You can find numerous cheap fast food as well as Michelin star restaurants.
8. Safety is exceptional in all parts of the city. Men, women or children can stroll the streets in any time of the day and night. Crime is much lower than in other parts of the region.
9. During late fall and early winter city is 'hibernating' its peak tourist season activities, just lite every other Mediterranean tourists spot, but during December, January, February and Spring, open spaces are filled with Christmas season, Saint Blasius (Patron of the city) festivities and celebration of Easter. So, it is always something to wait and enjoy.
10. Dubrovnik is located close to the borders of Montenegro and Bosnia and Hezegovina so You have possibility for short excursions to explore their towns and attractions. 
11. There is lot of interesting islands around town to visit. All with good internet speed and numerous scheduled boat lines so there is possible to combine work and pleasure.
12. During cold days local citizens on average heat only one room in the house or apartment. So there is much smaller offer or central heated houses or apartments, compared with offer during warm summer season. If heating is available heat air is available mostly from air condition units. 
13. Local people are very polite but it takes time to earn their trust. 
14. Another important information: its possible that Your perception of time differs from local perception of time. So arm yourself with patience when you need or ask for services, because something that in Your 'language' means 'Fast like-Today' in their 'language' could mean 'Fast like: This week'. 
15. Community is not very LGBTQ+ friendly but with long tradition in tourism industry they learned to tolerate it.
16. City, suburban and and intercity public transportation is well organized and reasonably priced.
17. Besides souvenir and jeweler shops there is a small number of shops for shoes, apparel, computers, sport goods etc. Choice is not rich and prices are higher than in the other parts of Croatia.
18. From May till end of October You may expect warm see ideal for sun tanning, swimming and other water sports.
19. Traditional Family connections and community care for children is very strong and evolved. Therefore Dubrovnik is declared to be 'City for Kids'. That stands for network of well equipped nurseries, elementary schools, high schools as well as lot of different sport and art activities. 
20. Croatia is member of the European Union so citizens of the EU have all rights as in any other EU country.",

Easy to get around speaking english everywhere, and plenty to do in such a beautiful place. Met a lot of excellent nomads and backpackers while there. Food and Drinks are about standard price for Europe (which apparently is due to inflation and the approaching Euro integration). There are a few coffee shops that have enough space to work from and cowork spaces outside of Old Town which had download speeds ranging from 100mbps (cafe) and up. My apartment was a bit slower at 25-30 download tops, but that was manageable. I could see myself spending much longer in Split, but will say when it comes to knowing the locals and nomads, it feels like a small town very quickly.

Also not as cheap as inland Croatia (e.g., Zagreb), but that shouldn't come as a surprise given its location and tourist volume.

Pros -It's one of the most beautiful cities on earth, cheap compared to Europe, beaches, surfing, vineyards, wildlife (I did cage shark diving and a safari in Addo), world class hiking (do lions head sunrise and sunset) also uber is cheap (£1.50 for most of my rides). 
Negatives - are the crime, depressing wealth/racial inequality, not recommended to go out alone at night, and in winter goes dark at 6pm, so go in summer. The nomad community isn't big but there is a FB group so join this. Also I'd say a co working space is necessary due to load shedding, and the wifi was on average 12-15mbps for me (this review below about 550mbps is inaccurate, and I worked in a couple of co working spaces)",

The wealth divide can be depressing and there are serious issues with crime, but with some vigilance and street smarts you can mostly avoid it.

The Shaftsbury Hotel is modern with two convenience stores, pharmacy, restaurants, dental, and more in the actual building. There is a rain fountain in "mall" of the building that would be Putrajaya's attempt at Singapore's airport one. The location is also literally right across from the bigger mall that has restaurants, international grocery store, movie theater, bowling, electronics, etc. It's a safe area if you're going to be in Malaysia for a week or two.",

review_text: "First time I was in KL was in 2015 as a backpacking student. I stayed for 2 weeks at an airbnb in Bangsar South and I loved it. Met up with Uni friends, made new friends and I really like the relaxed atmosphere, despite being in a huge city.

Fast forward, 3 years later, I went by myself to KL for a 3 days stay on a visa run from Chiang Mai. I stayed in a hotel near Bukit Bintang. I actually really didn't like it - I think because I was by myself, in a fairly wild part of the city and got so used to all the conveniences of Chaing Mai prior to coming here. I couldn't wait to leave this hell hole.... Ironically, as a student, I loved the crazier parts of the city, but maybe as we get older, that changes.

But then, 6 months later, I decided to give it another go, coming from Penang. This time with my girlfriend and back to the area where I first got to know KL back in 2015. We booked an apartment in Bangsar South. Swimming pool, gym, 1gbps internet connection, walking distance to supermarket, convenience store and metro to go exploring. Was an absolutely great month and ended up extending our stay by another 15 days until our visas expired. Cannot wait to go back after corona.",

THAT was actually a time when not only was everything ridiculously cheap; the locals were happy, friendly, courteous, always giving you a huge smile. I have so many happy memories of back then. 
Fast-forward to 2019: Yes, KL is now "on the map". Yet the cost of living is exploding; much of the city's heritage has been bulldozed away; a high-rise is going up at every corner; and more and more people are visibly stressed, frustrated, hostile. As a foreigner, I encounter silent treatment every day; have people shut the elevator door in my face; rarely get a Please or Thank You or even Excuse Me; the little annoyances just keep mushrooming. But all in all, and especially for those who never experienced the fun and relaxed KL of yesteryear, it's still a relatively safe and affordable place. Nowhere near as pricey as Singapore, and also not as prone to power cuts and violent crime and accidents as Thailand or Philippines. I see private doctors, and they are excellent, London/Cambridge-trained and yet affordable. Also, phone apps work quite well when it comes to payments, booking a Grab car or ordering food / groceries. And of course, the sky is blue and the sun is shining all year round.",

Malaysia’s food is marketed as a mix of all cultures’ cuisines, that’s nice and all but that mix of the same cultures is tastier in any food court in Singapore. Because in KL the food is average. Malaysians are also far behind in cafes, you’ll see Starbucks rated 5 stars, while arisanal boutique cafes are rated 2 stars on Foursquare. Why? Because they have a prehistoric obsession with big brands and consumerism. The coffee in the few artisanal cafes is outstanding. Everywhere else? Average. A day in KL means you’ll be going from mall to mall. Chinatown still has some remnants of local street authenticity, but even that’s starting to be bulldozed by malls its edge. Admittedly Kuala Lumpur has come far since a decade ago, its citizens are getting close to middle class (that is if you're not one of the millions of illegal immigrants). But where Kuala Lumpur now thrives in money, it still lacks in class. And that makes it, well, average.",

A piece of advice: don't ever come here alone for long time unless you are either attractive or have incredible social skills. The darkness is the most depressive aspect of Sweden but the people are not far from it either. Everyone thinks Sweden is very "progressive" but the people act as living in a small village anyway and are old fashion, specially regarding their social circles. My conclusion is that this is a place to come and have a family for the social benefits and nothing else. And even then you still need to go through 7 months of what any warm country considers winter and 3-4 months of above average dark days.",

review_text: "Just got back from spending a month in Stockholm (Feb-Mar), enjoyed the experience but perhaps went at the wrong time of the year as the weather was a bit wet / cold.

Was staying in hostels (~$30/night) and met some really interesting people - hostels were busy during the weekends but only about 30% full during weekdays (probably due to time of year).

Found the city about as expensive as London (where I'm from). City was very clean, easy to walk around and people were friendly with perfect English (and more than happy to speak in English).

I worked in SUP46 co-working space (free to work in the hot-desking area) and cafe's around the city (Espresso House was a good option). I looked at a few different co-working spaces but most were pay-monthly, which maybe I would have picked if I was living there longer.

My biggest issue was that there didn't seem to be much going on, I went to a few museums (recommend the Vasa museum) and explored some parks on the weekends (good for running around), however after the first couple of weeks, I ran out of things to see / do in my spare time. In the summer, I imagine people would go hiking around Stockholm, however the weather didn't allow me to.

Nightlife was okay, there is a great pub crawl called "Stockholm Pub Crawl", which is on every Friday and Saturday, highly recommend going as you'll meet some really interesting people. I ended up going on it a few times. Nightlife on weekdays seemed pretty dead.

Final point about weather, it was a little cold (-3 degrees C) when I got there and snowed / rained quite a few days, but was getting better by the time I left. I'd recommend going between April and September, as outside of these months it does get very dark and cold.

Overall, a city worth checking out (probably the best city out of Norway, Sweden and Finland) but not for longer than 4 weeks.",

Otherwise, you'll have to pay by card and get the official exchange rate, which is 50% of what you get on the black ("blue") market. There are many places to exchange cash. As an alternative to cash, I've also heard that people like to send themselves money with Western Union. I have no experiences with that.

But, as I'm saying, if you come with dollars is going to make a huge difference.

June 2020: 95 pesos= 1 USD. and if you're selling dollars in the informal market they will pay you $124. and with that you can buy two small doritos or 12 eggs. Which is a pretty good deal)

There's a lot to explain, and as usual, you gotta be careful because as the situation is getting bad the security is too. It's just about being careful and trying not to be walking on every street with your phone on your hands and that kind of stuff.

I really enjoyed being there January - March. It was hot but I never found it incredibly humid, though that changes by the year. Apartment prices can vary significantly. If you want the best deal I recommend searching through facebook and going to visit the apartment in person. If you don’t mind the premium Airbnb is good. 

Food is incredible and they are even getting more diverse vegetarian options as well as gluten free options in the city. Highly recommend downing the app Rappi - it’s like Uber for everything. You can sign up for unlimited deliveries for like something crazy like $5 a month. They can grocery shop for you, bring you cash from the ATM - it’s amazing.

Lastly for you non-European people I get my money via World Remit. It’s like western union but way less sketchy and also better rates. ATM are crazy there so you don’t want to be taking out cash from the machines often.",

I also recommend hiking at the ecological reserve “reserva ecológica”

The public underground metro called SUBTE is very efficient. The city has been adding bike paths. The locals were very friendly, outgoing, and easy to meet. They seemed interested in meeting people from other countries. I recommend trying to speak Spanish and they appreciate the effort. The women are also gorgeous and friendly to foreigners. 

Inflation is really making it hard for local people. Also as with most major cities, keep your cell phone and wallet in your front pocket and don’t be flashy with new iPhones. Using basic street smarts and simply staying alert at night, I had no issues. The Palermo and Belgrano neighborhoods seemed to be the safest and most relaxed. Make sure you try local foods, drink Yerba Mate with locals, take a weekend trip via a short train ride to “Tigre” where you can rent an affordable cabin and spend the weekend on the water, kayaking, fishing, drinking mate, etc. Argentina is really nice!

I see that hospitals are badly ranked in the Nomad ranking but I'd like to make a point here: public hospitals are free to use by anyone (no matter nationality nor residency status) and they are collapsed. Normally, people pay (the ones that can) around 100/110usd per month (the same way you pay in the majority of the countries) for a private health system which is excellent.

review_text: "Vienna is a cool city. Was there once in winter and once in summer and I liked being there more in summer. In winter is just horribly cold and it's all grey. In summer you can do lots of stuff outside, although the Danube riverside isn't as cool as in Budapest. 

Pros: 
- great food options (not only Austrian, but also for vegans)
- amazing architecture (really worth seeing)
- lots of things to do

Cons: 
- everything closes quite early (supermarkets at 8pm, come on)
- quite expensive (didn't remember and was shocked)
- not as nomad-like as Budapest

Vienna is more of a tourist city than a nomad or expat city. For a visit it's great but living there is expensive and although there are some cool coworking spots, it's not there yet. 

Nice places to get some good food: 
Swing Kitchen (Vegan fast food chain)
Ulrich (really nice place to enjoy a good breakfast)
Dachboden (for the views, not the drinks. Cocktails there are expensive and not really for most)
Drechsler (also a good breakfast)
Neni (if you want to enjoy good falafel and traditional middle eastern cuisine)",

Other Info:
COVID restrictions are very strict there (in a good and bad way). You need to provide proof of vaccination/recovery even to sit outside for a coffee. Not a problem if you are vaccinated but a huge one if you aren't.
FFP2 Masks are required everywhere - you will be turned away from places if you don't have one.",

1. Bulgaria is amazing in the Summer. (Varna!) Sofia is not. Will get boring super fast.
2. Life is a lot cheaper as listed here. 
3. 90% of Bulgarians are racists and hate GAY people. Lesbians are tolerated.
4. Food is amazing and cheap
5. Its dirty and poluted
6. People will try scam you (not only foreigners even locals get scammed). You can get beat up pretty easily without a real reason. My friend (local from Sofia) got destroyed by the security, for putting a Flower Vase in the nightclub to another spot as an example. 
7. Fake Alcohol is even common in the best nightclubs. You are never safe to order a expensive bottle. Only the cheapest Vodka is always safe because not worth faking it.
8. Women are STUNNING but english level is low. So you will have a hard time finding non gold digger that are more than 7/10 on the looks.

It's close to the mountains and there is hiking and winter sports. 

Sofia doesn't have the vibe of a top tier Euro city, but if you're a single man looking for an easy place to find a beautiful apartment for cheap, and maybe a beautiful girlfriend, Sofia could be up your alley.

I stayed there for 5 months and only remember the beach being clear 2-3 times. The seaweed stinks so that means the beach stinks. 

You have to go out of the tourist areas if you want to find some good food for a reasonable price or it's like you never left your home country. 
The police are very corrupt and known to rob tourists walking home from the bar at night.
You won't get bothered by gangs, it's the police you have to worry about. 

It's safe for the most part except for the random cartel hits that happen in broad daylight wherever it has to happen and with impunity. 

Not sure where the positive reviews are coming from, or at least I've been a nomad for long enough to know this place is a bad spot to live and work, only good for a weekend of partying and that's it. Literally any beach town in Thailand will be better than Playa Del Carmen",

I'd stick to places that look busy or have solid reviews online, though you should still expect receive very small portions of "ok" food for the $$$ you pay.

I am a coworking space kind of girl and even though there are a few here, they are all not great. Especially if you compare them to the spaces in Bali Canggu/Ubud for example.
In PDC it was all about choosing the lesser „evil“ for me. They are okay, but I didn‘t feel the same community vibes or very inspired in these places. 
The choices of healthy food here is very limited. Most places are all about meat, cheese and if you find something which sounds good and more healthy often is very bland. 
As others said it is very touristy but there is quite a few things to do, but in order to find out whats happening you need to be in whatsapp groups, which for me is not ideal. 
Getting around is decent as everything is quite close, yet the high temperatures make it always a sweaty endeavour.
Its mostly only comfortable to go out when the sun goes down.
Overall its not a bad place to be, but its not somewhere I see myself stay for a long time.",

I highly recommend getting a bike while you're here and immediately signing up for a coworking space (I use bunker coworking). Not all places have great wifi and you have to be specific on the upload/download speed that you require when contacting hosts with questions. Avoid tourist traps. Do not rent a place off of 5th Ave or 10th Ave unless you are in Playacar or way off of Calle 40 or higher because this is a party atmosphere at night. Otherwise, the food here is awesome, the people are kind to foreigners and most speak English. Prices are great (especially if you're a talented bargainer).

There's so much more to Playa. You can still party if you want, but I'd look at going to special music events like DJs, mini-festivals, more local places off of 5th, etc. And for food, 5th Avenue again is just a tourist trap - there are some really amazing spots to eat that are off the beaten track that will give you a better taste of Riviera Maya cuisine for a lower price and bigger portion. 

A lot of people just get overpriced rooms on or near 5th so they can walk around, limiting themselves to a tourist strip. I would recommend buying a bicycle at one of the shops on 10th Avenue to get around. It's actually a very bicycle friendly city. You can get them brand new for around 2000-2500 pesos at several shops there.

Using a bicycle will give you more freedom and not limit you to being stuck on 5th. Just follow locals and watch how they ride around so you can learn. Don't forget to get a lock, horn, and reflectors.",

The murder stats will tell you that this city has one of the highest murder rates of any non-warzone cities in the world. And the stats of how many journalists get murdered in Playa will tell you that you can't trust the press to be honest with you about the actual situation.

The best way to connect is via Facebook, believe it or not. It's still fairly active there. There are a couple groups. The city is a grid and the "Centro" part of town is below about 48 st. If you stay between 1st and 48st, crossed with 5th ave up to 15th, you'll be near everything. North of 48, you just see a lot of abandoned construction, trash, and poverty. People living in shells of buildings, putting up sheets for walls. Third World. Below 48th, you've got your choice of delicious restaurants, bars. and coworking. On the cross streets, 5th Ave is tourist central. 10th and 15th is for locals. Anything above that is the great unknown of a poor city. The housing market is depressed, so you can get great deals at airbnbs. Most modern buildings have rooftop pools etc. Every 3rd person on 5th ave will offer you weed and blow. The policia are just around the corner. I don't recommend it. Check out the coworking spaces and you'll probably meet people. On 5th, you'll just meet tourists. IMO the entire hoodmap should just be red for tourists along 5th ave, and the rest a new color representing Third World poverty. I didn't see any hipsters. Locals don't care about noise. They let their dogs bark unchecked forever. Guys on 3 wheelers bike around announcing cold treats with a clown horn that could drive you insane. 38th, 24th, 12th, are cool streets.

One huge piece of the city, 5th Avenue, runs from the bus stop for a mile or two and is pretty much nothing but tourist junk. Bad restaurants, bars, and people trying to hawk you on garbage. Once the touristy stuff dies out, there is a small but growing area that's much nicer for living - quieter, greener, few-to-no sales vendors fighting for your attention, and some really nice little restaurants and apartments. The beach is nice (although EXTREMELY thin, sometimes 1-2 feet wide at high tide), but sargasso (seaweed washing up) is a continuous issue and makes the beach pretty much unusable in parts. English is pretty good, but a little Spanish can go a long way. The scuba diving is excellent.

Recommendations: Get a bike to ride around. Eat at Primo (restaurant). Try to find an apartment with a pool or rooftop so the sargasso problems don't mess up your ability to enjoy the outdoors. Rent a car and take a trip to Chichen Itza and Ik-kil. Avoid Cozumel.

All in all, mostly pleasant, decent cost of living, but wouldn't be in a rush to come back.",

When I came prices for rentals were quite reasonable and I was able to get a lovely one-bedroom in an upscale neighbourhood for just 380 usd. Since, the war, prices have skyrocketed up to what one would expect to pay in a central Europe and even beyond. The quality of life hasn't increase in tandem with the prices, so I no longer felt it was a good deal. As a non-drinker, non-smoker, I felt it was hard to fit in socially. As a foodie, I was woefully disappointed. The food was heavy and basically the same in every restaurant, and the international fare was abysmal. I didn't like the fashion choices either for the most part. It was hard to find good quality goods in general. English is not widely spoken, but I could get by using my Russian; however, my English speaking friends had a hard time communicating. The level of service in most places is lacking. There is a lot of lovely nature though ,which is a plus. If you are a hiker, this place will be paradise to you. Most of the cultural events such as plays and concerts are in Georgian, so I was quite bored for most of my time there. The banking is great and it is easy to make this your base.

There are six days a week renovations INSIDE the building. We know that this can be the case in Tbilisi. Owners renovate in the summer. Some flats are strict about this, and other ones are not. We asked the agent of Remax to check this. She said she did, and there were no renovations planned for this summer. But obviously, this is not true. We live here now for 1 month, and almost every day there is noise from drilling.",

review_text: "We had some crazy situations with apartments scam - so please everyone be aware, that there are people pretending an RE agent. Always do a checkup of a realtor you are contacting. And the statement below that georgian people like to be 'dramatic'. Never experienced so much drama in my life, as from georgian landlords during 6 months of staying in Tbilisi ;)

I disagree with one of the reviews that Tbilisi has no parks. Actually it's super ridiculous thing to say about Tbilisi! The city has plenty of green spaces (Vera Park, Mtatsminda mountain, Turtle Lisi Lake and magical Mziuri and don't forget to mention Vake, where you can climb up the hill and you feel like you just transported yourself outside of the city in ~5mins ). Actually PARKS are my favourite in Tbilisi - because of them, as well as big sidewalks to walk (unseen in Chiang Mai for sure). Person who wrote about the lack of parks had to live on the wrong side of the river - only go for districst like Vera, Vake, Saburtalo and there the choice of parks is broad. 

What I didn't like about Tbilisi? I confirm that locals are unfriendly. City is very noisy (drivers are agressive, have no respect to pedestrians and beep a lot). 

Georgian goverment wants foreigners in their country so badly but locals mentality (very post soviet one) is not ready. They only want to get your money and the best would be if you dissapear just afterwards. 

Also you will have hard time to eat out as vegeterian - vegan. Places fully "green" are just a few. In other spots you can eat salads/chaciapuri which is cheese + carbs (for a vegan stays cucumber tomato salad - i wish you luck getting full with it :D).",

review_text: "I've been living in Tbilisi for 7 months.
The most surprising thing about the city was the welcoming expat community which is larger than I expected. Quality, well travelled people that are generally older (30's+). I met many good friends in a very short period of time.
The downtown area of the city is not ideal and can be noisy and polluted but the suburbs (only a 10min cab ride away), especially upscale Vake, is a better option in my opinion. It has a large beautiful park, lovely shops, restaurants and bars. Rent here is still quite cheap. All apartments are rented out fully furnished. You can get a nice large flat for as low as 200usd but 400 will get you a large modern flat.
Internet is very fast, up to 100mbps for about 30usd per month.
There are also many international restaurants but you may not find it as authentic as in other major cities.
Locals are not friendly generally speaking except in the villages. Communication in English can be difficult but not impossible.
Settling here for short or longer term is very easy, you can open a bank account and work legally on your visa on arrival. 
Banks like Bank of Georgia offer savings accounts for 3 months in the local currency with an 11.5% interest rate!
Safety is not an issue for most unless you go to the dodgier bars but at most they will rip you off. As a woman I feel totally safe night and day.
Drivers are aggressive but taxi's are cheaper than anywhere I've ever been to (about 2usd for a 15 minute ride) which you can get quickly and easily on Bolt or Yandex apps.
Overall cost of living is very cheap. You can easily live on less than 1000usd per month and still go out and have fun.
Also the country has handled covid very well and is one of the best countries to ride out the wave, everything is nearly back to normal, borders still closed in mid June.
Weather is mild, even in winter it's not too bad, heating and air-conditioning works well.
I really like it here!",

The pro's: It is easy to get a visa, has a growing expat community, easy to arrange mobile plan, gym, housing, etc and its all super cheap. Its perfect for bootstrapping and costwise even on par with Chiang Mai. Its also easy to take trips to the mountains and Armenia and taxi's itself are incredibly cheap. The city has a growing number of gems to eat, shop and drink.

Even though all the pro's above I personally wouldn't return. Besides expats it was difficult to make connections. The locals can be rude at times and love being dramatic and driving illogically big SUV's. The city was noisy, dirty and it was difficult finding places to run or relax since parks are non-existent and streets are in bad shape. Cheese, meat and wine sounds great at first but it gets boring real fast and it was difficult to eat healthy.",

If you're looking to bootstrap while you retrain yourself or start your online business, then Tbilisi is a great option. I've spent less in Tbilisi than I did in Chiang Mai. They speak better English than what some may suggest. I've gotten the wrong order a few times, but other than that, I have not had a problem with communicating. Internet is copious. I recommend Hurma and Althaus Tea Room for a couple great cafes to work from.

I found Georgians to be rather unfriendly, and it was difficult to make any local friends. Tbilisi is the worst city for gay life that I have ever been to, so if you're LGBT then don't expect much. On the other hand, Tbilisi is exceptionally safe. I walked home alone from the bar at 3 AM on several occasions and never felt any unease. Ohh, and the drivers in Tbilisi are aggressive, and the cars approach pedestrians too closely. Lastly, Georgian ATMs do not charge a fee and the exchange rates are at market rate. So with my Schwab account, I was able to pull money out completely free. Good and bad as with any city, but I will definitely return to Tbilisi, especially with the 1 year tourist visa and Ryan Air's new routes in Tbilisi.",

Special mentions to Rooms Hotel for the best late-night coding and coffee lounge, Urban Garden for best reasonably-priced gym, Restaurant Tiflis (by the bridge), Duqani, Shatre, and Machahkela resturant chain for inexpensive but great food, and Skola Coffee + Book Corner Cafe (opposite Restaurant Tiflis) for best daytime cafes you can work at. Best ice cream (by FAR): The Cone Culture.

Georgians are very friendly and hospitable. It's also the first ex-Soviet country to legalise 🍁, if you're that way inclined (you'll find Georgians willing to share nearly everywhere.)

However it's an Eastern European country and still poor, you gotta be careful.

I recommend you open a local bank account with TBC Bank (very easy process) and then use Transferwise to exchange into GEL.

Compared to US Cities, this place just works, it's very easy to live here and the public transportation is wonderful. It was also extremely cheap compared to any US city and I could afford to eat out every meal and go to the fancier restaurants on my US salary. The beauty of the buildings in the center and quick access to nature was my favorite part as well as the beer and drinking culture which is kind of built into the czech blood. There are a lot of traditional czech pubs but also some very interesting hip things that you would see in Berlin or Brooklyn, I was impressed for the size of the city how many quality offerings they had. 

As for cons.. there were a bunch too! Language is hard to learn and Czech people can be hard to warm up to you. Everyone was nice and could speak english but when going out in groups it often switches to Czech. I didnt mind this obviously because I am a visitor in their country but it was hard and felt isolating. The city is small and I felt like I saw almost everything in the 6 months. You can tour the main parts in one day but there are a lot of hidden gems and festivities that happen throughout the seasons to keep it interesting.

For Africa it's relatively progressive and I'm not sure why it gets a "not safe for women" (IME it's not perfect but no worse than many other countries around the world and much less regressive than Middle East, South Asia, etc.) It's an excellent jumping off point for the rest of Kenya which is very diverse (beaches/mountains/savannahs/deserts) - a bit like SF in that the city itself is great but a lot of the appeal is surrounding nature. Tech and nightlife scenes are vibrant.

Looking forward to going back to Bangkok and the more developed cities here in Asia. Maybe if you're into crazy adventures with third world style karaoke and other sketchy nightlife this is your place. Beaches could be nice for a few days -- I'm more into cities though.

Makati, BGC, Eastwood I've stayed in these areas for years and this is completely a first world bubble, so it is highly safe, walkable, livable and everything is just a walk's reach away as traffic can get extreme in Manila. Internet speed in cafes or public areas are quite slow or absent but the ones in your accomodation or hotel is fast. What I like about this city is like your living in 2 worlds, you can go to an area where it is 3rd world (you can find really budget items there), but at the same time you can go back to your first world gentrified bubble in Township areas such as McKinley Hills, BGC, Ortigas or Eastwood City.

There's a cafe called Antipodean that serves all day breakfasts, with excellent bacon and eggs, I stay 2 mins walk from there. I've stayed at Gramercy Apartments in Poblacion in the past and that wasn't good. That area is not very walkable and not much nearby except for some trendy bars.

Being close to Greenbelt means you have everything you need in the malls. Also, if you're a single guy, then it's a wonderful place for dating, especially if you have the courage to talk to locals that you see in day to day life.

Greater challenges are around eating nutritiously. I think Filipino food is underrated for its deliciousness but it's definitely not healthy. To better understand the Greenbelt area, it's a series of Malls (Greenbelt, Ayala, Glorietta, and some other mall). Collectively there would have to be upwards of 200 restaurants, so I'm sure there's a healthy option in there somewhere, just need to find it.

It's true that there's not a lot to do in the city outside of nightlife. And the infrastructure makes it a headache to get around. That's why I recommend staying in this part of town. In this part of Makati you can just walk everywhere. I've heard good things about BGC but have never visited.",

However, it can definitely be a dangerous city if you're being careless. About 10% of the people I've met had an incident there. I was mugged once walking home one night after the clubs in Ipanema, an affluent area.

It's definitely not as safe as in Europe (like Portugal for example), but it's nowhere near as dangerous as the media likes to portray. Most of the violence happens in the favelas which skews the stats. If you feel tempted to go but are worried about the safety, just book a flight and see for yourself. You won't regret it. My advice is to 1. Stay in "richer" areas so Ipanema, Copacabana, Leblon and even Barra da Tijuca. Avoid staying next to favelas. 2. Wear non flashy clothes. If you wear bracelets, ear rings or watches, you are increasing the chances of getting robbed. The whole time there I was just wearing a tank top and shorts. 3. Avoid going outside alone at night and also avoid the beaches at night. 4. Use uber. Cheaper and safer. 5. Learn some basic portuguese. It will go a long way! I hope you have fun :)",

It's everything the rest of Malaysia is not: Penang is clean, super safe, people are friendly, the food won't make you sick.

Penang probably is not the next nomad hotspot soon though but it could be. There's quite a lot of cafes, but not many are good for laptopping. Very few cafes have solid airconditioning, so it'll be hot. They do usually have fans though. Most buildings are small built here, so cafes can also be quite cramped and get crowded fast, especially around lunch and late afternoons. Also cafes close very early, like 5pm or 6pm.

Internet is legendarily slow, doesn't matter if it's in your hotel or cafe. Internet in Penang in general is just very slow. But there's an easy fix for that: buy a 4G Hotlink SIM card and top it up every day/week with a few gigabyte. Then use your phone to tether. It'll be extremely fast at around 40 Mbps, vs the WiFi's at 1 Mbps (!).

Great thing vs. for example Thailand is that people here speak almost perfect English, and compared to Kuala Lumpur people here are generally quite educated. Also about the people: Penangites are just really friendly and nice. They know you're a tourist and it doesn't matter, they're happy to help you get around and give tips where to go. Really friendly and chill people.

Food is good but I'll be real here, there's kinda limited options. Everything is either Malay, Indian or Chinese. Which is nice, but gets limited fast.

Some recommendations to work:
- Wheeler's cafe (ask or book beforehand to make sure you sit in the aircon area upstairs)
- Coffee Addicts cafe
- Daily Dose (make sure you order food here though cause they don't seem to like laptops that much)

To eat:
- Nasi Kandar Line Clear, yes it's an alley way but nice and you won't get sick, very clean: go there ask for rice and beef or chicken and vegetables and curry sauce, it'll be $2 or $3 USD, ask for hot tea, that's how locals eat it. It's open 24/7.
- Halab, a Syrian restaurant, it's not cheap (think $20 for a meal) but it's a loooot of grilled meat, good if you need protein after gym, also didn't get sick it so seems safe.

I think if Penang gets some nice aircon'd hipster cafes that like laptops, fixes its slow WiFi speeds everywhere and gets more nomads coming, it could very well become a new nomad hotspot in Asia.",

I got a great studio apartment at the Kim Haus for $620/month, which includes tourist tax of RM10 per day. Excellent location. But the internet is so slow it is unusable.

Food is excellent, you can literally eat every day out for less than $5 per meal + drink and never repeat the same restaurant.

I agree with people that there are many areas very close to the city center that are dirty and perhaps not very safe to walk around at night. Explore areas like Glyfada, Voula, Kifisia, Marousi, Psychiko, Marousi and you will be amazed with how different it is! The quality of life in such areas area way way WAY better than what you get by living in the city center. If you don't have a car, top tip would be to find a place with a metro station nearby.",

If you stay in the absolute cheapest part of town, you will get a different vibe. There are a lot of AirBnB springing up and in the off-season these are very reasonably priced. 
I can't understand how you could be bored in Athens. So many places to see, so many museums and historic sites, beaches, clubs, mountains, markets and...
Check out some of the closer islands, but steer clear of the ones frequented by Cruise Ships like Mykonos and Santorini. The prices in these places are not really reflective of the rest of the country.",

You can get easily by with nothing but English, though tossing an occasional συγνώμε and παρακαλώ in the mix helps. That, of course, as long as you stay in the pricey parts of the city.

With a bit of luck and some advance planning Athens can be extremely affordable. There are Airbnb listings quite far away from the center, yet close to a metro station -- for less than 800€ per month you can get a two bedrooms + a kitchen + a large balcony next to a reasonably quiet street.

This, of course, works only for those who are more or less busy working from Monday to Friday. For something resembling more like a tourist visit, you'll be paying at least twice for a flat near the center and quite likely end up in somewhere with plenty of motorcycle noises to keep you awake all night, every night.",

People are more reserved, perhaps even a bit suspicious, so I would not say it was an OVERLY welcoming vibe, however there are a lot of expats from the US, CA, UK and more, so I did meet some very nice people and there is a good Expat network there.

- Only use ATMs that has the word “Bankomat” on it, all the other ATMs have really high fees or commission and may even in some cases support organized crime.

- if you need to call the police for some reason, because of e.g. robbery or physical injury, make sure to call the state police or ask for the state police and not the municipal police. The municipal police can be very corrupt and in some cases support organized crime. 

That’s my advice, take care.",

And here are some pros and cons about this city:

Pros.
- Super safe!
- Fast & free wifi almost everywhere
- Great transportation system: You can go literally everywhere in the city via bus & subway
- Many coworking spaces (Most IT startups are located near Gangnam, Yeoksam, and Seolleung station.)

Cons.
- Lots of restaurants serve in groups, so you might feel awkward eating alone at the first time (It's even hard for me too tbh haha)
- Quite many people fear speaking English (It's not you, it's the language they are afraid of)

Below are few tips to survive in the city:
* If you learn how to read Hangeul, the Korean alphabet. It will make your life in Seoul much pleasant and easy.
* Use KakaoMap || NaverMap (They provide much more accurate information than Google Map, and ofc they support English)
* Samsung pay is available everywhere!
* When you are working in a cafe, it is okay to leave your laptop and go to the restroom. (Don't worry. No one will steal your stuff.)
* When you are in a cafe, check out for wifi passwords before throwing away the receipts.",

It's extremely clean, modern and futuristic with neon lights and flashing screens everywhere. The modern architecture in this city is impressive and beautiful. It wouldn't take much to convince yourself that you've travelled 100 years into the future.

The food is amazing and you have to try Korean barbecue at least once if you visit this city. It's also very cheap, you get lots of bottomless free side dishes, service is quick and you don't have to tip. There's lots of interesting things to do like Karaoke (very different from the western type that's done in a bar), virtual baseball or golf, interesting museums or going to a jimjilbang (spa).

Perhaps the most amazing thing about this city is the extreme level of convenience. Transport is very cheap, efficient and so clean that as a European, you will not believe your eyes. Everything is open and accessible 24/7 in many areas. This includes restaurants, shops, cinemas, laundromats, jimjilbang, libraries, you name it. Even at 3am you can live it up like it's early evening. You can also walk in to one of the many cheap hotels at any hour and find a clean room. Wi-Fi is everywhere, very fast and often free.",

review_text: "Spend a few hours and learn the Korean alphabet (not that hard) and Google some names of Korean dishes + it's spelling in Korean. It will help a lot as most restaurants only have Korean menu's and often without pictures.

As mentioned previously on the reviews, it's a little hard to eat alone, but Gimbab Chonguk (김밥천국) is everywhere and 24/7 - no one will bat an eye. Also look for places that "specialises" in dumplings, They are usually "alone-eating" friendly. And so are ramen places as well as Korean "chinese" restaurants - Jajangmyeon (자장면) is very good and super addictive. Bibimbab restaurant places are fine too. Actually, it's not that hard to eat alone in Korea. The "group" meals are generally quite obvious and will be things like BBQ. You'll figure it out.
Do Get used to kimchi and spicy food otherwise you'll end up eating the same thing all the time. Be adventurous. Challenge yourself and eat an octopus alive (산낙지). If you're really brave try 보신탕 before authorities close them all - I haven't but a lot of Weagukins (foreigners) secret do. 

Cafe's generally have really good wifi, as you would expect from one of the most connected countries in the world. Expect to pay $4-6 for a latte and maybe even more at Starbucks.
Best cafe's are usually around Hipster areas and Universities. Indie owned cafe's are awesome.

Nightlife is great, probably amongst the best in Asia. Can get very expensive especially at night clubs in Gangnam where it would could be like $10 for a beer - in that case you can still get drunk for $2 with soju just outside at 7Eleven.

Winters are stupidly cold and summers can be brutally hot & humid. Go between April and June or September to October. They have cherry blossoms in spring which is beautiful and so are the autumn leaves.

Lived here for many years. It's a cool place and vastly underrated.

Seoul is continuously becoming more expensive and cost of living will soon be comparable with places like Tokyo.",

review_text: "Seoul is lovely but still has some challenges for nomads. Korean food is great, but most restaurants are used to serving groups, or at least couples. Many times you'll simply be refused service entering a restaurant alone. Unlike Japan, eating alone is stil frowned upon in Korea and mostly impossible. Exceptions are of course expat areas like Itaewon which are more used to it. Also outside signage and menus are mostly still in Korean, without any English translations generally. Even if you learn the Korean characters, you won't know the words, so this makes it impossible to order. This is slowly changing though, especially in hipster areas. You might ask "why does this reviewer care stuff is in English or not, they're in Korea, what does he expect?". Well, it's 2018 and Korea presents itself as an international country, English should be the default sub text. There's more challenges, it's very difficult to meet Koreans, you'll always be seen as the "token" foreigner in social groups. This is understandable and to be fair it's much worse in Japan than Korea. Unless you're in expat areas, you'll feel fairly isolated because Koreans will generally avoid you for fear of having to speak English. This makes it a potentially very lonely experience for any nomads. This is kinda vicious because Koreans look down on people that are alone. Hence the group-eating thing. Solutions to that? Come here with a group of friends. You'll have a MUCH easier time.",

Also taxis can become really expensive, short ride can jump into 6 euros, moto is a better solution but again, pollution and safety is not really into vogue. Also about food, there are no fridges in the supermarket so your milk or daily products must be buy in local shops, and again hygiene is not at its best. Woman friendly is not so much... you must cover you up in order to don't attract followers... there are no go zones in Kathmandu... and also be aware of bands of dogs... Internet is good speed after the earthquake, most houses have solar power so you will be able to be online full time... getting a SIM card needs the help of a local, since again SIM cards for foreigns need a permission, so is not easy going as a city... in fact is really chaotic and super dirty.... is not a 100% walkable city... is a moto city, and again is super dirty, so I you want to walk in rainy season better to not have bear foot...

review_text: "Melbourne is a fun and cute compact city. There are so many fun things to do here such as visit is beaches, go to its theme parks out of the CBD area. Its city CBD is so much fun as well. You can visit the Queen Victoria market which is the largest outdoors market in the world! You can also visit Federation Square which is a beautiful park on the edge of the CBD, and you can visit the Eureka Skydeck and Australia 108 which are the tallest buildings in Australia if you exclude the antenna from the Gold Coast's Q1 tower. If you are into surfing, there are surf beaches about a 1-2 hour drive out of the Melbourne area at the nearest.
Melbourne is a really good city to reside in if you like fun, but of course it does come with a cost. Melbourne is the 6th most expensive city in the world according to recent reports.
Overall, an awesome city",

It's definitely not cheap (on par with Singapore/Paris/etc), but it has everything needed for nomads: coworking spaces, 4g, lots of cafes with good wifi. The food is really good, there are many things to do. I didn't have any issues with my Ru debit card anywhere. I'd say it's a good destination.",

review_text: "Great for a visit. Beautiful scenery. Good food. I thought it would be great to live here, start a startup and be in the same time zone as SF, close to Seattle, etc. But compared to Vancouver in 2009, one big change that totally ruined it for me: Absolute zombie apocalypse of drug addicts and shouting/violent home less people. It was shockingly bad. The locals often visibly carry naxalone (anti-overdose medicine, I learned) because there are so many people overdosing in the street. Police were nowhere to be seen. Such a shame, I would have loved to live in this beautiful city otherwise.",

I can see how it wouldn't appeal much to single long-stay visitors. I call it "Singaportland" when trying to describe the vibe to remote colleagues. Clean, safe, orderly, but a bit constructed. You pay a serious CoL tax for the perks. Zero appeal for Chiang-Mai-nomad types, based on pricing and culture.",

review_text: "I think the reviews here a bit overly negative. It's true it's a city with a not of nightlife or activity, but that's not why people move to Vancouver. You move to Vancouver if you want a relaxed lifestyle with beautiful nature and access to the outdoors, fresh air, and a good climate (by Canadian standards), without having to give up on the comforts of a city-lifestyle. 

While it's expensive, you mostly get quality. My rental is not that much more expensive than I paid in many european cities, yet I get a completely modern flat with mountain views, and countless amenities (gym, pool, sauna). It's true Vancouver housing is expensive, but usually it's very high quality. For food, Vancouver has some of the best selection of asian cuisine you can find, and the prices are quite reasonable imo. 
If you want a nightlife oriented life, or a crazy vibrant urban experience, you won't find it in Vancouver. If you want a calm base in one of the most naturally beautiful regions in the world, and are willing to spend a bit of money for it, then Vancouver is a good fit. I've lived in 10+ cities and Vanouver may be my favorite, although it's true it's not for everyone.",

review_text: "Read the review that starts "I live here and I can tell you that many of the stats listed are wrong" - its spot on accurate
I will add to that - Vancouver is brain-numbingly boring and dead. There is noticeable and toxic mix of pedestrians, cyclists and car drivers. Mix in a very Vancouver trait of entitlement, and watch the the passive aggression fly. 
Vancouverites generally are a cold bunch making it difficult for newcomers. Worst of all they believe in their own created hype that live in the best world-class city. It does get annoying.
Pretty, yes, in places, good mountains, excellent outdoors. Beyond that, dead!",

review_text: "I live here and I can tell you that many of the stats listed are wrong. Getting an edible dinner for $10 is an utter fantasy. Typically that's what you pay for an appetizer. A 1-bdr in the city centre will cost you at least $1600 but probably more like $2000+ and chances are it will be a hell-hole at those prices. The night life is indeed terrible here. The saving grace is that there's dozens of micro-brewery pubs with very interesting beer very close to the city centre. But they're legally required to close at 23:00 and after that your options are mostly trash unless you happen to have insider knowledge about arty happenings. Most of the night life is so bad that it will make you feel like a tourist even if you're a local.
There is no Uber or ride-sharing of any kind here, the taxi lobby is far too strong. 
Tipping? Absolutely yes, minimum 15%! People that work in restaurants here cannot survive on their meagre wages. 
A really important thing to know is that listed prices here never include tax, so everything costs 12% more than you thought it would -- and at a restaurant your cost including taxes and tip will be at least 30% more than what you see on the menu. 
Don't come here unless you're looking for a quiet retirement. Go to Seoul or Berlin or Montreal instead. It will be cheaper, more social, more cultured, more fun, and there will be a lot more to do.",

The way it works is FreeSpace partners with local restaurants that are only open in the evenings and transforms them into unique, comfortable and affordable drop in coworking spaces during the day while the restaurant is closed. The don't have private boardrooms or phone booths for confidential exchanges, but they do have free coffee, outlets at every seat, and super fast Wifi (300mbps- I was surprised!). It doesn't have all of the bells and whistles that a lot of other coworking spaces available but if you are just looking for somewhere to stop in, grab a coffee, and get to work, this is an excellent alternative at a fraction of the cost.

Yes, there are safety concerns so you must take precautions, however, I found the locals to be extremely warm and friendly (the one thing I wasn't expecting when I arrived), the weather is spot on, it's very cheap, good quality new build apartments in places like Sandton, Rosebank, Parkhurt, Bryanston etc and AMAZING quality restaurants e.g you can get an excellent fillet steak and a glass of wine for $15 in a high end restaurant. The going out scene was a little quiet but you could definitely find bars clubs open until 2/3 am. Meeting people I found easy as all the locals want to talk to you. A nomad wanting a high quality and cheap lifestyle I think would enjoy it. With that being said, Cape Town would be the better choice for a Nomad in South Africa.",

review_text: "I have been to Jo berg twice. The last time being 3-years ago. Each visit was not pleasant as being in the city reminded me of being in Northern Ireland in the early 1980’s. I was in the British military and engaged in various bits and bobs in the most dangerous village in the country (based upon the number of security forces who lost there lives there). The reason I mention this is the ‘vibe’ in Jo Berg is exactly the same as it was in Northern Ireland’s ‘murder central’. The only exception is i was walking around without the comfort of a weapon in my hands and three other desperados backing me up (we operated in 4 man teams). I have had a look at the ‘scores’ section on Jo Berg and it is in no way representative of the situation on the ground. Whether you are an expat, nomad or a whatever please understand that Jo Berg is not a place to go ‘sight seeing’ in unless you have a couple SUV’s rammed with black water personnel following you. Joking aside there are better places to live in Southern Africa.",

At an elevation of 2,389 metres (7,895 feet) above sea level, it is located at the centre of the Highveld area of the Transvaal Basin, on the east bank of the upper reaches of the Vaal River. It is one of the most developed cities in Africa, and is the major centre of South Africa's economy.

The city is ranked as the 22nd-largest city in the world, and the largest city in Africa, with a population of approximately four million, encompassing a metropolitan area of over ten million. Johannesburg is the largest of South Africa's four national, co-constitutional capital cities, which are also the largest cities in the country.

Johannesburg is usually called Joburg, its nickname, and has been known as the City of Gold, due to the large gold mining industry, the major source of its prosperity, in the late 19th and early 20th century. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange is one of the largest stock exchanges on the African continent. The city is a major centre for commerce, industry, entertainment, and culture. Gold is mined in Johannesburg, and many of the city's buildings have a mining theme.",
